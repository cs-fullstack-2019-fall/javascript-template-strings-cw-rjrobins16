# JavaScript template strings class work

Good work. 2/2 correct. Score : 5 points. 

### Exercise 1:
Create a template string and assign it to the variable ```my_template_string```.

The template string should contain the following data only:

```
My name is ${my_name}.
My id is ${my_id}.
My address is ${my_address}.
```

Create the variables ```my_name```, ```my_id```, and ```my_address``` and set their values to ```Kevin```, ```2112```, and ```Memphis, TN```.

Use the template string you created and assigned to the variable ```my_template_string``` to log the formatted output to the console.

Sample Output:
```
My name is Kevin.
My id is 2112.
My address is Memphis, TN.
```


### Exercise 2:

Create a new template string 

```
var contestant = "1_M_l337!";
var score = "9001";
```

and use the provided variables to print 
```
Congratulations 1_M_l337! !!, your score is 9001.
```

### Exercise 3:

Using the provided Object literal, create a template string  and iterate through the Parents and Children and print them in a format sililar to the following:
```

    	SCHOOL PARENT LISTING
        

Parent's Name: Mr. Bill
Children: 
Sluggo 
Spot 
Linda

Parent's Name: J. Page
Children: 
Mick
Robert
John
Kenny

Parent's Name: Randolh H.
Children:
Biffy
